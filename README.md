# Comparing Geo-Coding Approaches for Stratified-based Geospatial Online Sampling

This project aims at comparing several geospatial data dimensionality reduction and geo-coding approaches for designing stratified-like geospatial sampling methods. We have it implemented for geohash encoding and we aim at comparing that with Uberâ€™s H3 and Googles S2 geo-encoding systems.
