# instructions
## follow the following instructions
1. [ ] run the example starting code and familiarize yourself with some geosaptial processing techniques, including:
    - sampling
    - spatial join
    - geo-visualization

2. [ ] reference papers include:
    > [1. online spatial sampling](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Isam-Al-Jawarneh/publication/339562314_Spatial-Aware_Approximate_Big_Data_Stream_Processing/links/5ff45764299bf14088708888/Spatial-Aware-Approximate-Big-Data-Stream-Processing.pdf) and
    > [2. AQP](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/15/8/263)
    > [3. AQP](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/12/4160)
In those papers, geohash encoding have been used for sampling, your task is to use ```Google's S2``` and ```Uber's H3``` for encoding, and build a sampler based on those and then compare the accuracy and time-based QoS constraints!
3. [ ] search appropriate open source implementations for those algorithms in Python!, for example:
    > [S2 Python](https://pypi.org/project/s2/)
    > [s2 RegionCoverer](https://github.com/pantrif/s2-geojson)
    > [geojson to H3](https://github.com/uber/geojson2h3)
    > [H3 grid](https://geographicdata.science/book/data/h3_grid/build_sd_h3_grid.html)
    >[H3](https://h3geo.org/docs/api/regions/)
    >[H3-geojson](https://github.com/kapil-grv/H3-geojson)
